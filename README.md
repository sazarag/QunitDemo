QUnit: A JavaScript Unit Testing framework.

What is QUnit?
QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. 
It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code, including itself!

I developed a demo applicaiton to see features of this test framework.
